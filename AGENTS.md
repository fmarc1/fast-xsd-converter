# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/` contains the TypeScript implementation; public API lives in `src/index.ts`.
- `index.ts` re-exports `src/` for package consumers.
- `tests/` contains Bun test files (`*.test.ts`).
- `data/` holds fixtures and golden outputs (e.g., `data/test-xsds/basic.xsd` -> `data/test-xsds/expected/basic.json`).
- `bench/` has benchmarks; `dist/` is generated by builds.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `bun run build`: compile TypeScript to `dist/` using `tsconfig.build.json`.
- `bun test`: run unit/integration tests with Bun's test runner.
- `bun run bench`: run benchmarks; set `BENCH_ITERS`/`BENCH_WARMUP` to tune.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Use TypeScript with ESM imports; keep the public API in `src/index.ts`.
- Match existing formatting: tabs for indentation and single quotes.
- Name tests as `*.test.ts`; keep fixtures paired with expected JSON.

## Testing Guidelines

- Prefer fixture-driven tests using `data/test-xsds` and `data/test-xmls`.
- Update `data/test-*/expected/` JSON when conversion output changes.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes or new features land.
- Keep test names descriptive and focused on one feature.

## Documentation Updates

- Update `README.md` (and `CHANGELOG.md` when applicable) whenever new features, options, or behavior changes are introduced.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Use short, imperative subjects (e.g., "Add list union handling") and scope if helpful.
- PRs should include a summary, tests run, and fixture updates when outputs change.

## Release Notes

- Follow `RELEASE.md` for publishing: bump `package.json`, update `CHANGELOG.md`, run `bun test` and `bun run build`, then tag.
